# Considerate Cat

## Overview

**Considerate Cat** is my passion project being built with artwork from The Considerate Cat Tarot : www.consideratecat.com. Its currently in early stages of development but will eventually be a working app for users of the deck to reference cards, get readings, explore stories of the cats and dive deeper into the artwork and story behind the deck. I'm using Typescrip, React, and MUI to build this project.

## (Future) Features

- **Interactive Tarot Readings**: Engage with various Tarot spreads for insightful readings.
- **Customizable Themes**: Personalize your experience with themes and layouts.
- **User Accounts**: Secure user authentication and profile management with Supabase.
- **Responsive Design**: Accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Tarot Card Library**: Explore meanings and interpretations of different Tarot cards.
